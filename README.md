This Dev Platform app flags via reports:

* Comments on old posts that include a URL
* Edited comments that didn't originally include a URL, but are edited to include one within 28 days

By default, an "old post" is one that is 30 days or older, but this setting can be configured as you wish.

Only comments made since the app was installed will be checked on edit. This is because the app needs to check the original body text, and this is only stored once the app is installed.

Comments over 28 days old will not be checked on edit. This is to reduce the data retention requirements of the app.
